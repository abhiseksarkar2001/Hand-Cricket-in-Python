# Rules to play Hand Cricket

Hand cricket is a simplified version of cricket, typically played between two individuals.

### The rules of the game are as follows:

1. Number of overs: The game is played over a pre-determined number of overs, each over consisting of 6 balls.

2. Batting and bowling: One player bats while the other bowls. The batting player scores runs by hitting the ball and the bowling player tries to get the batting player out.

3. Scoring runs: The batting player scores runs by hitting the ball, with the number of runs scored depending on the number of fingers used to hit the ball. A score of 0-6 is possible, with a score of 0 indicating the batting player is out.

4. Getting out: The bowling player can get the batting player out by accurately predicting the number of runs the batting player will score on the next ball. If the prediction is correct, the batting player is out.

5. Switching roles: After 6 balls, the roles of batting and bowling are switched, and the game continues until all overs are completed.

6. Winning the game: The team with the highest score at the end of the game wins. In case of a tie, the game is declared a draw.
